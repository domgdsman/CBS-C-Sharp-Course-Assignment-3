# CBS Introduction to Programming and Application Design (C#)

###### This is the third mandatory assignment of the course.

Three reflection points about the assignment:

- I have generally understood the principles of object oriented programming, but it is still hard to find the cleanest, most readable and shortest solution of writing code, as there are so many options: Using constructors or not, when to use an interface and when not to.
- I learned that upcasting and downcasting are very useful methods of making parent methods available to the child classes or modelling the further development of a class to a sub-class. I was struggling a bit to understand what the role of the default constructor is in that matter. Without it, the casting would result in a null value instead of the desired class object.
- I found it peculiar, that a MainMenuInput() method needed an int returned on all pathways, even though the last return in the code would never be reached due to the preconditions in the code at the top.
